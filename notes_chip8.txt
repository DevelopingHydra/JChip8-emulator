---------- registers
16 8-bit registers (V0, .. VF)
one 16 bit register called I; usually used to store memory addresses --> the lowest (rightmost) 12 bits are usually used

---------- memory
the memory is 4 KB (4.096 bytes) from 0x000 (0) to 0xFFF (4095)
the first 512 (0x000 - 0x1FF) bytes is where the interpreter is located and should not be used by games
most games start at 0x200 (512) and some begin at 0x600 (1536)

VF should not be used by programs, because its used as a flag

there are also 2 8-bit registers for timers, which decrement at 60Hz (60 times per second)

There are also pseudo-registers
PC --> program counter (16-bit); stores the currently executing address
SP --> stack pointer (8-bit); points at the topmost level of the stack

the stack is an array of 16 16-bit values, used to store the address that the interpreter should return to when finished with a subroutine
therefore chip-8 allows for up to 16 levels of nested subroutines

---------- timers & sound
one for sound, one for delaying things
both times operate at 60 Hz (they decrement 60 times per second)
when reaching 0 they deactivate

the sound-timer (ST) --> outputs a peep if its value is greater than 0
the delay-timer (DT)

---------- GRAHPICS
64 x 32 pixel
graphics are drawn as 8 x 1 .. 15 pixel sprites

origin is upper left corner (0,0)
x is calculated by mod 64 (0 to 63)
y is calculated by mod 32 (0 to 31)

all drawings are in XOR mode
when one or more pixels are erased while a sprite is drawn, the VF register is setr to 01, otherwise 00

characters are 8 x 5 pixels (5 bytes)
Available letters are 0-9 and A-F

--------- input
hexadecimal keyboard
(16 keys --> 0-9 and A-F)

--------- instructions
CHIP-8 had 36 different instructions including math, graphics and flow control functions
Super CHIP-8 added additional 10 instrauctions

All instructions are 2 bytes long and are stored most-significant-byte first
In memory, the first byte of each instruction should be located at an even address
If a program includes sprites data, it should be padded so any following instructions will be properly situated
